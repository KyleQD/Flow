## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. **`scripts/create-real-blog-accounts.sql`** - Main setup script for real accounts
2. **`app/api/feed/blogs/route.ts`** - API endpoint for fetching blog posts
3. **`app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`** - Blog post detail page
4. **`docs/BLOG_ECOSYSTEM_SETUP.md`** - This documentation

### Modified Files
1. **`components/feed/for-you-page.tsx`** - Updated to fetch real blog posts and make them clickable

## How to Set Up

### Run SQL Script in Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `scripts/create-real-blog-accounts.sql`
4. Execute the script

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Stage Name Error
If you encounter the error `column "stage_name" does not exist`, the script now includes a fix for this. The `refresh_account_display_info` function has been updated to use `artist_name` instead of `stage_name`.

### Profile Image URL Error
If you encounter the error `column "profile_image_url" does not exist`, the script now includes dynamic column checking. The function will automatically detect which columns exist in your `artist_profiles` table and adapt accordingly.

### Duplicate Key Error
If you encounter the error `duplicate key value violates unique constraint`, the script now uses `gen_random_uuid()` to generate unique IDs for posts, ensuring no conflicts with existing data.
