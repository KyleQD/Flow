-- Private docs storage bucket and policies
-- Create bucket if not exists
insert into storage.buckets (id, name, public) values ('private-docs','private-docs', false)
on conflict (id) do nothing;

-- Enable RLS on storage.objects (default in Supabase)

-- Allow authenticated users to upload to their org-scoped folders via API (service role) or their own user folder
-- For download, we'll issue signed URLs via server (no broad read policy here)

-- Write policy: allow inserts from service role or authenticated users to the bucket
drop policy if exists "private-docs-insert" on storage.objects;
create policy "private-docs-insert" on storage.objects
  for insert to authenticated
  with check (bucket_id = 'private-docs');

drop policy if exists "private-docs-insert-svc" on storage.objects;
create policy "private-docs-insert-svc" on storage.objects
  for insert to service_role

-- Update policy: service role only
drop policy if exists "private-docs-update" on storage.objects;
create policy "private-docs-update" on storage.objects

-- Delete policy: service role only
drop policy if exists "private-docs-delete" on storage.objects;
